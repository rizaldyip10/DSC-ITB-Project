# DSC-ITB-Project

# What Did I Do?
This can be count as the first project that i did for DSC ITB using Tensorflow. In this project, i try to classify a bank note is fake or real. The neural network is trained based is trained based on the available features. Then it is feed on the network to study the network. In the end, i want the model to be able to predict whether a bank note is fake or real. 
# What Did I Learn?
I learn that tensorflow very usefull to determine the fake and the real data. It is very usefull for database security confirmation.
